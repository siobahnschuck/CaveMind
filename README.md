### **_Description_**

! ENTER LOGO HERE !
CaveMind is a virtual cave wall where users can add drawings. As more users participate the wall quickly becomes a global graffiti wall and begins to tell a story, just as prehistoric cave drawings do. The end iteration will be a collaborative digital artwork. Each drawing a user contributes to the cave is saved to their profile.
